    "Though most of the content here is my own explorations and my own dumb ideas, I have chosen to organize this series of Notebooks roughly based on the organization of Mark Lutz' authoritative (and massive) book _Learning Python._  These notebooks are aligned with the numbered major parts of his book.  This notebook aligns with his chapters covering Python __Statements and Syntax.__\n",

So, I am reaching into the world of ships and fleets for concepts to use as coding examples.  Warships have many things that directly connect with object oriented concepts.  We can start with the point that warships are designed and constructed in classes. \n",

    "Iteration means taking each item of something, one after the other.  This means some kind of collection with some kind of order (sequence.)  Iteration implies looping, whether implicit or explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mark Lutz acknowledges that there is great terminology ambiguity here amongst Python authors, and that other authors use iteration terms interchangeably.  However, Mark is determined to be clear about his own distinct terminology.  Here is my interpretation of his confusing definitions.  (He uses words with \"iter\" root three times per sentence.)\n",
    "\n",
    "An __Iterable__ is either a physical sequence (such as a list) or an object that can produce one result at a time when cued. The result can be computed on demand when cued. The sequence can be of finite length.  Like everything else in Python, an iterable is an object.  The result produced could be any number of different kinds of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "An __Iterator__ is an object that provides the programmatic interface to the iterable object. The iterator provides the class methods and exception generation for iteration activities.  A list object is just a list, and needs an iterator object to provide the iteration methods, most specifically the NEXT method.\n",
    "\n",
    "An __Iteration Tool__ or __Iteration Context__ is a programmatic construst to produce iteration.  A FOR statement can be an iteration tool.  A comprehension can be an iteration context.  Such a tool or context may also contain the iterable or iterator (depending on which methods and exceptions it provides.)  For example, a file is an iterable, but the file object is its own iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterables\n",
    "Iterables are sequences where it is possible to visit each element of the sequence, and perform some operation on that element (and move on.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Official Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterable is an object capable of returning its members one at a time. Examples of iterables include all sequence types (such as list, str, and tuple) and some non-sequence types like dict, file objects, and objects of any classes you define with an __iter__() or __getitem__() method. Iterables can be used in a for loop and in many other places where a sequence is needed (zip(), map(), ...). When an iterable object is passed as an argument to the built-in function iter(), it returns an iterator for the object. This iterator is good for one pass over the set of values. When using iterables, it is usually not necessary to call iter() or deal with iterator objects yourself. The for statement does that automatically for you, creating a temporary unnamed variable to hold the iterator for the duration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterators\n",
    "Iterables are objects providing the class methods and exception generation to make it possible to perform iteration activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Official Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "An object representing a stream of data. Repeated calls to the iterator’s __next__() method (or passing it to the built-in function next()) return successive items in the stream. When no more data are available a StopIteration exception is raised instead. At this point, the iterator object is exhausted and any further calls to its __next__() method just raise StopIteration again. Iterators are required to have an __iter__() method that returns the iterator object itself so every iterator is also iterable and may be used in most places where other iterables are accepted. One notable exception is code which attempts multiple iteration passes. A container object (such as a list) produces a fresh new iterator each time you pass it to the iter() function or use it in a for loop. Attempting this with an iterator will just return the same exhausted iterator object used in the previous iteration pass, making it appear like an empty container."
