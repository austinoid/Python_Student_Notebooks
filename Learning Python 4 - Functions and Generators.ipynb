So, I am reaching into the world of ships and fleets for concepts to use as coding examples.  Warships have many things that directly connect with object oriented concepts.  We can start with the point that warships are designed and constructed in classes. \n",

    "\n",

    "- Variables assigned within a function definition (DEF) is _local_ to that function\n",
    "- Variables assigned in an enclosing function defintion (outer nested DEF) is _nonlocal_ to inner nested functions.\n",
    "- Variables assigned outside all function definitions is _global_ to the entire file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions define a local scope and modules define a global scope, with the following details:\n",
    "- The enclosing module defines a global scope.  There isn't really any universal global scope.  \"Global\" means \"module.\"\n",
    "- Global scope relates to single module only.  There isn't really any universal global scope.  \"Global\" means \"module.\"\n",
    "- Assigned names are local only, unless declared otherwise.\n",
    "  - Assignment makes a variable local, including displacing something named higher up.\n",
    "- All names not assigned locally are assumed specifically to be either local to the enclosing function, global, or built-in. \n",
    "  - Modifying a variable defined higher up changes the global object. \n",

    "- Exception variables in TRY / EXCEPT structures.\n",
    "- Local variables in CLASS statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope Best Practices\n",

    "Our Python development team leader says that he will kick out of the source code repository anybody he finds using nested functions.  When pressed, he admitted they might be used in the case of something extraordinary that couldn't possibly be done any other way.  However, he promised testing and maintenanc problems, and developing this section has borne that out.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, Lutz has led me here, so let's thrash this out.  Here is what I am finding by wrestling with this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Philosophy:  Every function has its own name space.  Data should be passed to functions as arguments.  If there are extraordinary reasons a function should \"know\" or \"see\" variables from higher in the hiearchy, we have methods with difficult and dangerous repurcussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In nested functions, each \"deep\" function can \"read\" the value of variables defined in higher level functions.\n",
    "However, a \"deep\" function cannot change the value of a variable defined higher unless it is declared NONLOCAL.\n",
    "\n",
    "My summary of the rules discovered for these controls:\n",
    "1. Module-level variables may be read by nested functions.\n",
    "2. Local function variables may re-use Module-level variable names, but will only have local function scope.\n",
    "3. Local function may change module-level variables, but only by using GLOBAL statement.\n",
    "4. Functions cannot change the scope of a variable in execution.  (Python acts like conventional compiler here.)\n",
    "5. Local function may create and populate new module-level variables using GLOBAL statement.\n",
    "6. Function-level variables may be read by deeper nested functions.\n",
    "7. Local function variables may re-use higher-nested function variable names, but will only have local function scope.\n",
    "8. >Local function may change higher-nested function variables, but only by using NONLOCAL statement.\n",
    "9. >Functions cannot change the scope of a variable in execution.  (Python acts like conventional compiler here.)\n",
    "10. >Local function may NOT create and populate new higher-nested function-level variables using NONLOCAL.\n",

    "\n",
    "Rule 10 is the opposite of its corrolary Rule 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples have way more code than needed to prove the bullet points, but leave something to work with for more complex testing later.\n",
    "Some tests for our code to explore:\n",
    "- What happens when deep functions change global variables?  Error, or a new temporary local with same name?\n",
    "- What happens when deep functions change higher nonlocal variables?  Error, or a new temporarly local variable?\n",

    "An iterable is an object capable of returning its members one at a time. Examples of iterables include all sequence types (such as list, str, and tuple) and some non-sequence types like dict, file objects, and objects of any classes you define with an __iter__() or __getitem__() method. Iterables can be used in a for loop and in many other places where a sequence is needed (zip(), map(), ...). When an iterable object is passed as an argument to the built-in function iter(), it returns an iterator for the object. This iterator is good for one pass over the set of values. When using iterables, it is usually not necessary to call iter() or deal with iterator objects yourself. The for statement does that automatically for you, creating a temporary unnamed variable to hold the iterator for the duration of the loop."

    "An object representing a stream of data. Repeated calls to the iterator’s __next__() method (or passing it to the built-in function next()) return successive items in the stream. When no more data are available a StopIteration exception is raised instead. At this point, the iterator object is exhausted and any further calls to its __next__() method just raise StopIteration again. Iterators are required to have an __iter__() method that returns the iterator object itself so every iterator is also iterable and may be used in most places where other iterables are accepted. One notable exception is code which attempts multiple iteration passes. A container object (such as a list) produces a fresh new iterator each time you pass it to the iter() function or use it in a for loop. Attempting this with an iterator will just return the same exhausted iterator object used in the previous iteration pass, making it appear like an empty container."
